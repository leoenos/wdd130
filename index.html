        <p>Hiya! I'm Le'o. I'm from Colorado and I like listening to music and playing games. Though I spend most of my
            time only playing games, I would absolutley love to listen to any music recommendations you have. I'll
            listen to any
            genre. When I'm not working, I'm typically reading or hanging out with friends. I was born and raised here
            in Colorado,
            but I look forward to travelling more in the future. I really want to be successful in my studies so I can
            start
            working towards a career! I'm 23 years old and am always up for meeting new people. My favorite season is
            winter so I am excited for the
            following fall season and for all the snow to come during or after. I'm mostly down to do anything so let me
            know if you're up for an adventure!</p>

        <p>Colorado is known for its versatile terrain ranging from flat plains, to rolling hills, to mountain peaks. It
            famously
            hosts a large portion of the Rocky Mountains where beautiful views, hikes, and trails can be explored. Its
            state capital
            is Denver and the state borders New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona where they all meet in one corner.</p>
